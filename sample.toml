# This file is a sample of some things you 
# can do with this leader key setup. It's active
# right now! Set leader_key below and try it! The 
# lua prioritizes home.toml, then work.toml,
# then falls back to this sample.toml. If you
# want different profile names, you can add it
# to the list in ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua.
